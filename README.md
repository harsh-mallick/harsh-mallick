# Hi, I'm TechSorcerer ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

Hey there, I'm Harsh Mallick, a 15-year-old with a passion for all things digital. I've dabbled in full-stack web development and 3D design, pouring my creativity into bringing virtual worlds to life. Exploring the latest AI releases is my jam; I'm always on the lookout for new online tech to integrate into my projects.

Aside from coding and designing, I find solace in studying chemistryâ€”it's like unlocking the secrets of the universe. Balancing my love for science with my ambition as a JEE aspirant keeps me on my toes, but I thrive on the challenge.

Whether I'm crafting immersive web experiences or experimenting with chemical reactions, I'm driven by a blend of technical expertise and insatiable curiosity. Each line of code and each equation I tackle propels me forward on my journey to become a polymath, leaving my mark on the digital realm and the scientific community alike.
